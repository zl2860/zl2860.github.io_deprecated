# A Bayesian model of hurrican trajectories


------------------------------------------------------

[[report]](./Project4.pdf)

- Implemented regular Metropolisâ€“Hastings algorithm to achieve stationary distribution in Markov Chain.

- Estimated parameters and the numerical standard error and constructed the 95% CI from the results.

- Predicted the spatial moving trends and wind speed of the hurricanes.

# Analyses of daily COVID-19 cases across nations


------------------------------------------------------

github repo: https://github.com/zl2860/COVID-19

[[report]](./project3.pdf)

- fitted a logistic growth curve to model the COVID-19 cases data.

- Estimated parameters by gradient descent. The growth curve formula were transformed firstly in order to obatin the intial parameters for optimization.

- Implemented both Gaussian Mixture Model with EM algorithm and Kmeans algorithm to cluster the estimated parameters for each countries.

- Investigated the association between growth modes and countries by comparing and analyzing the resulted clusters

# Implementation and optimization of algorithms on cancer diagnosis dataset


------------------------------------------------------

github repo: https://github.com/ys3298/computing_proj2.git 

[[report]](./cancer.pdf)

-	Built a predictive model based on Logistic Regression to facilitate cancer diagnosis

-	Trained Logistic Regression models with Newton Raphson, Gradient Decent algorithms from scratch in R (No package used)

-	Decreased the misclassification rate by 4%, via implementing a Logistic-LASSO Regression model with Path-wise Coordinate Descent

# A Simulation Study to Compare Two Bootstrapping Methods for propensity-score matching


------------------------------------------------------

github repo: https://github.com/jaredgarfinkel/P8160_project1_group1.git

[[report]](./proj_1_group_1-1.pdf)

- Generated 15 scenarios of epidemiological confounding data with weak, meidum and strong confounding relationship between covariates and continuous & binary outcomes

- Randomly Generated 1000 datasets for each scenarios for calculating the true effect and variance

- Comducted the propensity score matching method via both complex and simple bootstrap to calculate and compare the varibility of the average treatment effects with true variance



------------------------------------------------------

#  The fragility index in clinical trials

------------------------------------------------------

website: https://yy3019.github.io/P8105_final_project.github.io/index.html

- Built a dataset containing general information of more than 320000 clinical trials based on
the sources from clinicaltrials.gov

- Built a shiny-app visualizing the spatial distribution of the clinical trials in the United States

- Assisted in building a fragility index calculator for meta analyses with different methods,
measures and random effects

# Identification of a Radiomic Signature for Improving Individualized Medicine in Colorectal Carcinoma 

------------------------------------------------------

Sun-Yat Sen University

github repo: https://github.com/zl2860/radiomics-R.git                          

- Used Python libraries to apply a Laplacian of Gaussian filter in CT images and extracted nearly 1280 first order statistics, texture and shape features from the transformed and original images

- Selected the robust features that can be used for cancer prediction via LASSO regression and finally identified nearly 30 robust features by using R packages

- Calculated the rad-score for each patient based on the selected features and conducted a survival analysis among patients with high, medium and low levels of rad-scores, verifying the predictive value of the selected features

# Prediction for Incidence Rates of Cervical Cancer and Endometrial Carcinoma in Shandong, China Based on Gray Model (1, 1)

------------------------------------------------------

Department of Biostatistics, Shandong University                                 

- Calculated the crude, age-standardized and urban(rural) incidence rates of cervical cancer and endometrial carcinoma in Shandong Province, 2013~2017

- Built an improved gray model(1,1) with high accuracy by Python to predict the incidence rates of cervical cancer and endometrial carcinoma from 2018 to 2020 in Shandong, verifying other previous prediction of the incidence rates
