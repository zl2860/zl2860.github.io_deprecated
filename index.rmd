# About 

I received a BS in Preventive Medicine from Shandong University in 2019 and currently study biostatistics in Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University. I am passionate about the field of biomedical engineering, epidemiology and health data science. I am also preparing for applying to doctoral programs in epidemiology and biostats. The following are some of the research projects that I have been working on:

**A Big Project for transformation between ICD-10-CM code and Clinical Classification Categories, Excessive Morbidity Assessment, as well as Cluster Analysis**
