# About

I received a BS in Medical Science from Shandong University in 2019 and currently study biostatistics in Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University. I am passionate about the field of biomedical engineering and health data science. I am also interested in applications of the wearable sensors in healthcare and computational epidemiology/biology. You may learn more about me from [`here`](./CV-ver. 2019.pdf).
