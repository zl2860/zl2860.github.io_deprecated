# About 

I received a BS in Preventive Medicine from Shandong University in 2019 and currently study biostatistics in Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University. I am passionate about the field of biomedical engineering and health data science. I am also preparing for applying to doctoral programs in computational/quantitative biology or epidemiology. Currently I am learning tensorflow and hope it would help in my future research. You may learn more about me from [`here`](./LIU, ZONGCHAO_2020.pdf).
