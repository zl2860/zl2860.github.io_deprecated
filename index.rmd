# About 

I received a BS in Preventive Medicine from Shandong University in 2019 and an MS in  Biostatistics in Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University in 2021 (advised by `Dr. Ying Liu` and `Dr. Guohua Li`). I am passionate about the field of biomedical engineering, epidemiology and health data science. I am also preparing for applying to doctoral programs in epidemiology and health data science. The following are some of the research projects that I have been working on:

**A Big Project for transformation between ICD-10-CM code and Clinical Classification Categories, Excessive Morbidity Assessment, as well as Cluster Analysis**

**Controlling FDR: A 3D-based interpretable deep learning framework for diffusion tensor brain imaging data**
